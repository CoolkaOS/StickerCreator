# StickerCreator
Creats suitable images for stickers in TG.

My friend asked me to crop some images for him.
At first I was doing it manually. But he saw my struggle and proposed to Python it.
And it is my result.


## Manual:

1. Put your images in __input__ folder.
2. Run __main.py__.
3. Proceed in terminal.
```
We detected such images to crop:
name#1
name#2
...
Do you want to proceed(Y,N)?
```

4. Get your stickers in __output__ folder.

```
name#1  is done.
name#2  is done.
...
```
5. You are brilliant! You are able to find your pngs in __output__ folder.
